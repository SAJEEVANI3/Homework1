#FinTech Case Study


## Overview and Origin
* Robinhood -Incorporated in 2013
Robinhood is a broker-dealer application that allows users to trade stocks, options, ETFs and cryptocurrencies with zero commission fees. It also allows users margin trading through Robinhood Gold, their premium account tier.

* Cofounders and co-CEOs: Baiju Bhatt and Vlad Tenev

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
As stated on their website, roommates/classmates at Stanford, Baiju and Vlad realized that most Americans were charged commission for trading stock, whilst big Wall street firms effectively paid nothing. This made them realize that it was more important to build products that would give everyone access to the financial markets, not just the wealthy – the result was Robinhood (named after the medieval outlaw who took from the rich and gave to the poor), an app that was easy to use, free and addictive and one that leverages off technology to encourage everyone to participate in the financial systems both newcomers and experts.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Current total Funding amount: $5.6 billion
Robinhood is funded by investors, including venture capital firms (lead VCs DST Global, Sequoia Capital, D1 Capital Partners, IVP, TSP Consumer Partners and Ribbit Capital). 
Their latest funding was raised on 01/02/2021 from a Debt/Convertible Note issue for $2.4 billion.


## Business Activities:
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 
“Democratize finance for all” – this is Robinhood’s mission statement. 

The Financial Markets industry is dominated by the Market makers/Wallstreet firms, with expert financial knowledge, extensive resources, and traders who performed extensive technical and fundamental analysis to trade and who also paid little or no commission on the transactions.
Whereas the retail platforms that were offered to the larger public were bulky, required trade minimums and charged brokerage. 

Robinhood provided a platform to its clients and the general masses that was easy to use, with 0 brokerage charges, no minimum trade requirements and gave access to trading in stocks, options, ETFs and cryptocurrency. Their subscription-based Gold premium account (USD6 per month) also allowed margin trading. Thus, giving the larger retail public easy access to the financial markets.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 
The average age of Robinhood user is 31 (NYT), their target market mainly being the young and unsophisticated investor i.e Millennial’s and Gen Zs.
In May 2020, Robinhood revealed it had 13 million active users (NYT) and the current number is estimated to be around 20 million.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
“We designed Robinhood to be mobile-first and intuitive, with the goal of making investing feel more familiar and less daunting for an entire generation of people previously cut out of the financial system. Our focus has always been on breaking down systemic barriers to investing to help more people take control of their finances.”  
-Company statement (18/02/2021: usatoday.com)
As stated on a company statement given above, Robinhood is an easy to use/intuitive, mobile service. There are no minimums for entry and customers are provided shares of a low-priced stock at point of registration and has been designed to make it easy to invest even in the most expensive stocks without much capital with margin trading.

It is designed to not charge brokerage but makes its revenue through what is known as “payment for order flow” income. It uses a smart order router, an algorithm to prioritize a customer order to a market maker directly (as opposed to executing the order through an exchange) that is likely to give the best execution, based on the historical performance. Robinhood receives a rebate from the Market Maker, a percentage of the bid-ask spread.

It has also the advantage of being developed as a highly additive gamified platform, that provides a romanticized notion of Robinhood style trading to a young unsophisticated demographic. It is also authorized to trade options, which have been described as sexier than stocks because, like hitting a single number on a roulette wheel, they can offer more bang for the buck.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape:
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Capital Markets

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Capital Markets have been moving more towards automated technology driven solutions to traditional methods of trading, settlement, and post settlement activities. 
The drive has been towards the use of artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), APIs, blockchain/distributed ledger technology (DLT), cloud, data management, microservices, and other technologies to support new solutions.
- AI to enhance pricing decisions – Automate pricing and risk management for faster, less manual methods - freeing up human involvement for more strategic work
- Blockchain for data transparency and driving processes without human intervention
- Adoption of cloud technology, cloud infrastructure – real time data insights, improve data sharing, process big unstructured data to get valuable insights for improved business decisions and operational efficiency
- Smart contracts boost trade efficiency - Smart contracts are DLT (distributed ledger technology) based contracts that are executed by computer systems once their underlying criteria is full filled. Traditional trade settlement is a lengthy process with delayed transaction time due to intermediaries, clearances, and regulatory compliance.
- Platformification – generate new customers and revenue streams esp. given younger investors are more inclined towards technology and require a wide range of digital tools for their decision making
- Quantum computing – to recognize patterns, to run complex simulations for risk management and solve algorithmic trading problems faster than traditional digital computers

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
E-Trade, Schwab, Firstrade, M1 Finance, TD Ameritrade, Interactive Brokers


## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Changed the landscape of the traditional investor.
Robinhood changed the narration of the traditional investor (institutional and large banks) and brought forward and entire new generation of young (average age 31) retail investors and day traders into the market.
These retail investors challanged the traditional market dynamics and metholodogoes used by the finance gurus and industry experts. This was apprant in the ongoing and much covered incident of the gamestop saga, 
where a reddit mob (wallstreetbets, a Reddit forum) of retails investors caused a jump in GameStop share price (a struggling seller of video games), began to buy these shares.
The share price went upto a peak of 350 on Jan 27. These stocks were heavily in short-sell positions in the market by professionals, far above the number of shares (at 140%) in circulation, which caused what is known as a short squeeze.
GameStop short-seller Melvin Capital suffered a 49% loss in the 1st-quarter after being hit by the Reddit-fanned trading frenzy. (12/04/2021: businessinsider)

Caused other industry giants to change and cut commissions to compete. 
In September 2019, E-Trade, Schwab and TD Ameritrade, industry giants many times Robinhood’s size, cut commissions to $0. And a few months later, Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo’s brokerage unit followed suit. 
This removed the easy-money trading commissions that generations of stockbrokers had and which formed the financial foundation of Wall Street brokerage firms. As this source of revenue evaporated, brokerage stocks plunged. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Customer base, Capital/Company value, revenue growth and Market share

Customer base -The number of users of the app has grown from half a million in 2014 up to 13 million in May-2020. It is estimated that this number is closer to 20 million now.

Capital/Company value -It was recently valued at $20 billion pre-IPO, although secondary shares have valued the company at $40 billion

Revenue -Revenue growth year-on-year and has momentum.
2015	$2.9 million
2016	$9.3 million
2017	$21 million
2018	$69 million
2019	$111 million
2020	$673 million

Market share -Still low compared to similar competitors in the Market
Robinhood	$20 billion
E-trade		$600 billion
TD Ameritrade	$1.3 trillion
Charles Schwab	$3.8 trillion


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Gaining market share - Robinhood is expanding in Market share, although not quite upto the competitors

Robinhood average account size vs competitors -Although it has a high number of customer, the account base compared to it's competitors is very low. 
Robinhood	$3,500
E-Trade		$100,000
TD Ameritrade	$110,000
Charles Schwab	$240,000

Robinhood's entire business is built on selling its customers’ orders to trading titans like Citadel Securities. 70% of Robinhoods income is from pay for orderflow; compare this to Schwab, so-called PFOF or “payment for order flow” only accounts for 3% of revenues. ETrade, 17%.
So, although the outright fees are 0; Robinhood earns a chunk of their income through the back end. 
Robinhood Q1 2020 Revenue breakdown
-Payment for order flow -70%
-Premium membership subscriptions -15%
-Securities Lending -15%


## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)
-Educate its customers esp given the highly speculative nature of the trades and unexperianced customer base (Kearns tragedy - Alexander Kearns, who was using Robinhood to trade complex options instruments committed suicide after running a debt of USD750k),
Notifications/e-mails to customers on the positions/mtm details to keep track of P&Ls
Trade simulations for practice
-Offer/expand products such as IRA accounts; which is an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) that is designed for building retirement savings.
-Expand to Forex, Futres products 
-pricing schedules; a fixed-rate plan and a tiered schedule
-Integrate self-directed strategies along wth the automated solutions based on historical trends

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
-Avoid reputational damage
-To expand product offerings and exapnd to other demographics (potentially higher value) 
-Exploring new markets/ expandimg Globally
-Utilizing a more advantageous pricing structure to attract higher value customers
-Purely relying on historic trends to execute trades can be restrictive. Integrating self directed stratagies can give the company more depth and potential.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
